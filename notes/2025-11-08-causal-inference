# Causal Inference in Physics

How might Pearlian causal inference help formalize **energy flow** or **information flow**?

- Nodes: physical quantities (energy, entropy, temperature).
- Edges: causal dependencies (e.g., \( Q \rightarrow \Delta S \)).
- Possible integration: structural causal models with Hamiltonian mechanics.
