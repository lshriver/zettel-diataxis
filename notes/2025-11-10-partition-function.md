# The Partition Function as Generator

> “The partition function is the Hamiltonian of thermodynamic inference.”

- \( Z = \sum_i e^{-\beta E_i} \)
- All macroscopic observables can be derived from derivatives of \( \ln Z \).
- Serves as a *generator of flows* between energy, probability, and entropy.
