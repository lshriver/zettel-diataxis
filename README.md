# Zettel–Diataxis Hybrid

This is a lightweight structure for writing and publishing notes quickly using GitHub Pages.  
It blends the **Zettelkasten** idea (atomic notes) with **Diataxis** (tutorials, how-tos, explanations, reference).

## Writing workflow
1. Add Markdown files in `notes/` or `topics/`.
2. Commit and push.
3. GitHub Pages rebuilds automatically.
4. Your site is live at `https://<username>.github.io/zettel-diataxis/`.

No build tools. No npm. No stress.
